Chapter 1: What is Scope?

Fundamental paradigm of a programming language is the ability to store values in variables.

Scope - well-defined set of rules for storing variables in some location, and for finding those variables at a later time.

Compiler Theory

JS is a compiled language.

A chunk of source code, our program, will undergo three steps before it is executed.
Compilation is composed of:1) Tokenizing/Lexing - breaking up a string of characters into tokens.  var a = 2; is broken up into: var, a, = , 2, and ; .  Lexing is JS compiler figuring out if tokens are distinct or combined.

2) Parsing - takes the stream of tokens and turning it into a tree of nested elements, which collectively represent the grammatical structure of the program.  This tree is called an "AST" Abstract Syntax Tree.  Nodes include: Variable Declaration(var), Identifier(a), AssignmentExpression(=), NumericLiteral(2).
3) Code-Generation - the process of taking an AST and turning it into executable code.  JS compiler taking the JS syntax and turning it into machine code.

JS has to be compiled before (usually right before) it's executed.

Understanding ScopeThe Cast - 

1) Engine: responsible for start-to-finish compilation and execution of our JS program.

2) Compiler: one of Engine's friends; handles all the dirty work of parsing and code-generation.

3) Scope: another friend of Engine; collects and maintains a look-up list of all the declared identifiers (variables), and enforces a strict set of rules as to how these are accessible to currently executing code.

Back & Forth

var a = 2;

1) Compiler will tokenize and parse into an AST tree.
2) Compiler will then produce machine code.

Encountering var a, Compiler asks Scope to see if a variable a already exists for that particular scope collection. If so, Compiler ignores this declaration and moves on. Otherwise, Compiler asks Scope to declare a new variable called a for that scope collection.
Compiler then produces code for Engine to later execute, to handle the a = 2 assignment. The code Engine runs will first ask Scope if there is a variable called a accessible in the current scope collection. If so, Engine uses that variable. If not, Engine looks elsewhere (see nested Scope section below).
3) Engine executes the code.
	If engine doesn't find a variable in scope, JS will result in an error.
	
To summarize: to distinct actions are taken for a variable assignment: First Compiler declares a variable (if not declared in the current scope) and second, when executing, engine looks up the variable in Scope and assigns to it, if found.

Compiler Speak

Two types of ways Engine looks up a variable scope: LHS and RHS.

LHS - Left hand side - when variable is  on the "left hand side" of an assignment operation.
When the variable is ASSIGNED a value. When the reference is on the left.RHS - Right hand side - when a variable is on the "right hand side" of an assignment operation.  When a variable's value is "retrieved" - "go get the value" When the reference to the variable is on the right.

console.log( a ); = RHS reference, nothing is being assigned, instead we are looking-up or retrieving the value of a so that value can be passed to console.log( .. );

a = 2; LHS reference, we want to find the variable as a target for the =2 assignment operation.

function() {….}.function name()  = function declaration.
{….} = function definition.

Engine/Scope Conversation

function foo(a) {
	console.log( a ); // 2
}
foo( 2 );
Let's imagine the above exchange (which processes this code snippet) as a conversation. The conversation would go a little something like this:
Engine: Hey Scope, I have an RHS reference for foo. Ever heard of it?
Scope: Why yes, I have. Compiler declared it just a second ago. He's a function. Here you go.
Engine: Great, thanks! OK, I'm executing foo.
Engine: Hey, Scope, I've got an LHS reference for a, ever heard of it?
Scope: Why yes, I have. Compiler declared it as a formal parameter to foo just recently. Here you go.
Engine: Helpful as always, Scope. Thanks again. Now, time to assign 2 to a.
Engine: Hey, Scope, sorry to bother you again. I need an RHS look-up for console. Ever heard of it?
Scope: No problem, Engine, this is what I do all day. Yes, I've got console. He's built-in. Here ya go.
Engine: Perfect. Looking up log(..). OK, great, it's a function.
Engine: Yo, Scope. Can you help me out with an RHS reference to a. I think I remember it, but just want to double-check.
Scope: You're right, Engine. Same guy, hasn't changed. Here ya go.
Engine: Cool. Passing the value of a, which is 2, into log(..).

Nested Scope

Scopes are nested inside other scopes.  So, if a variable cannot be found in the immediate scope, Engine consults the next outer containing scope, continuing until found or until the outermost (aka, global) scope has been reached.

function foo(a) {
	console.log( a + b );
}
var b = 2;
foo( 2 ); // 4
The RHS reference for b cannot be resolved inside the function foo, but it can be resolved in the Scope surrounding it (in this case, the global).
So, revisiting the conversations between Engine and Scope, we'd overhear:
Engine: "Hey, Scope of foo, ever heard of b? Got an RHS reference for it."
Scope: "Nope, never heard of it. Go fish."
Engine: "Hey, Scope outside of foo, oh you're the global Scope, ok cool. Ever heard of b? Got an RHS reference for it."
Scope: "Yep, sure have. Here ya go."

From <https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch1.md> 

Errors

RHS look-ups that fail to ever find a variable result in a ReferenceError.

LHS look-ups that fail to ever find a variable result in the automatic/implicit creation of a variable with global scope (only if strict mode is not enabled.)

LHS look-ups that fail to find a variable (while strict mode is enabled) result in an Engine error of ReferenceError.

TypeError is when you try to do an illegal/impossible action with a RHS reference variable. ie: execute as a function a non-function value, referencing a property on a null/undefined value.

Review (TL;DR)
Scope is the set of rules that determines where and how a variable (identifier) can be looked-up. This look-up may be for the purposes of assigning to the variable, which is an LHS (left-hand-side) reference, or it may be for the purposes of retrieving its value, which is an RHS (right-hand-side) reference.
LHS references result from assignment operations. Scope-related assignments can occur either with the = operator or by passing arguments to (assign to) function parameters.
The JavaScript Engine first compiles code before it executes, and in so doing, it splits up statements like var a = 2; into two separate steps:
	1. First, var a to declare it in that Scope. This is performed at the beginning, before code execution.
	2. Later, a = 2 to look up the variable (LHS reference) and assign to it if found.
Both LHS and RHS reference look-ups start at the currently executing Scope, and if need be (that is, they don't find what they're looking for there), they work their way up the nested Scope, one scope (floor) at a time, looking for the identifier, until they get to the global (top floor) and stop, and either find it, or don't.
Unfulfilled RHS references result in ReferenceErrors being thrown. Unfulfilled LHS references result in an automatic, implicitly-created global of that name (if not in "Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode]), or a ReferenceError (if in "Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode]).

Chapter 2: Lexical Scope

Scope - the set of rules that govern how the Engine can look up a variable by its identifier name and find it.

Lexical Scope - most common type of scope.  As opposed to dynamic scope.

Lex-time

First traditional phase is called lexing (aka tokenizing).

Lexical Scope - is scope that is defined at lexing time.  Lexical scope is based on where variables and blocks of scope are authored, by you, at write time, set in stone by the time the lexer processes your code.



Bubble 1 - encompasses global scope, one identifier foo.

Bubble 2 - encompasses scope of foo, identifiers = a, b, bar.

Bubble 3 - encompasses scope of bar, identifiers = c.

Scope bubbles are defined by where the blocks of scope are written (DEFINED), which one is nested inside the other one.

Bubbles are discretely nested, no bubbles are crossing over boundaries.  No bubble for some function can simultaneously exist (partially) inside two other outer scope bubbles.

Look-ups

Engine executes console.log(a,b,c); and looks for the three referenced variables: a,b,c.
a is found in the scope of foo.
b is found in the scope of foo.
c is found in the scope of bar.

Scope look-ups stop once it finds the first match.

No matter where a function is invoked from, or even how it is invoked, its lexical scope is only defined by where the function was declared.

Cheating Lexical

Cheating lexical scope leads to poorer performance.

eval(..) function takes a string as an argument, and treats the contents of the string as if it had actually be authored code at that point in the program.

function foo(str, a) {
	eval( str ); // cheating!
	console.log( a, b );
}
var b = 2;
foo( "var b = 3;", 1 ); // 1 3

eval(str) evaluates the string and creates var b with scope foo.

with - short-hand for making multiple property references against an object without repeating the object reference itself each time.

function foo(obj) {
	with (obj) {
		a = 2;
	}
}
var o1 = {
	a: 3
};
var o2 = {
	b: 3
};
foo( o1 );
console.log( o1.a ); // 2
foo( o2 );
console.log( o2.a ); // undefined
console.log( a ); // 2 -- Oops, leaked global

console.log(o2.a); is undefined even though an auto-created global variable a is created with value = 2. (That is why console.log(a) yields 2).  console.log(o2.a) remains undefined because there is no PROPERTY created/named o2.a.

The with statement takes an object, one which as zero or more properties, and treats that object if is a wholly separate lexical scope, and thus the object's properties are treated as lexically defined identifiers in that "scope".  

Performance

both eval(…) and with cheat author-time defined lexical scope by modifying or creating new lexical scope at runtime.

JS can pre-determine where all variable/function declarations are, therefore less resources are required to resolve identifiers during execution.

However, if eval() and with are used, the engine has to assume that identifiers can exist everywhere therefore cannot optimize for variable/function declarations.

Code will run slower.

Review (TL;DR)
Lexical scope means that scope is defined by author-time decisions of where functions are declared. The lexing phase of compilation is essentially able to know where and how all identifiers are declared, and thus predict how they will be looked-up during execution.
Two mechanisms in JavaScript can "cheat" lexical scope: eval(..) and with. The former can modify existing lexical scope (at runtime) by evaluating a string of "code" which has one or more declarations in it. The latter essentially creates a whole new lexical scope (again, at runtime) by treating an object reference as a "scope" and that object's properties as scoped identifiers.
The downside to these mechanisms is that it defeats the Engine's ability to perform compile-time optimizations regarding scope look-up, because the Engine has to assume pessimistically that such optimizations will be invalid. Code will run slower as a result of using either feature. Don't use them.

Chapter 3: Function vs. Block Scope
 
Scope From Functions

JS has function-based scope.
 
function foo(a) {
        var b = 2;
// some code
function bar() {
                // ...
        }
// more code
var c = 3;
}
 
From <https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch3.md> 
 
Scope bubble for foo(..) includes identifiers: a, b, c, and bar.
Bar has its own scope bubble.
Global scope has its own scope which includes identifiers: foo.
 
Function scope encourages the idea that all variables belong to a function, and can be used and reused throughout the entirety of the function.
 
Hiding In Plain Scope
 
You can "hide" code by wrapping a function declaration around it.
This is useful because it can minimally exposes what is necessary = less resources used.
Principle of Least Privilege.
 
function doSomething(a) {
        b = a + doSomethingElse( a * 2 );
console.log( b * 3 );
}
function doSomethingElse(a) {
        return a - 1;
}
var b;
doSomething( 2 ); // 15
 
From <https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch3.md> 
 
var b and function doSomethingElse() are exposed = bad software design.
 
function doSomething(a) {
        function doSomethingElse(a) {
                return a - 1;
        }
var b;
b = a + doSomethingElse( a * 2 );
console.log( b * 3 );
}
doSomething( 2 ); // 15
 
From <https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch3.md> 
 
var b and function doSomethingElse() are now enclosed within the doSomething() scope.
 
Collision Avoidance
 
avoids unintended collision between two different identifiers with the same name but different usages.
 
function foo() {
        function bar(a) {
                i = 3; // changing the `i` in the enclosing scope's for-loop
                console.log( a + i );
        }
for (var i=0; i<10; i++) {
                bar( i * 2 ); // oops, infinite loop ahead!
        }
}
foo();
 
From <https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch3.md> 
 
the i=3 in the bar() will overwrite. Compiler will do a LSH lookup to find it in the next level scope (for loop) (since the i in the bar() is not locally declared).
 
changing the i to var i will fix the problem. also known as a shadowed variable.
 
Global "Namespaces"
 
libraries are typically created as an object with various internal/private functions (as properties of said object). This pattern is called Global Namespace.
 
Functions As Scopes
 
var a = 2;
(function foo(){ // <-- insert this
var a = 3;
        console.log( a ); // 3
})(); // <-- and this
console.log( a ); // 2
 
From <https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch3.md> 
 
Instead of polluting the global scope with identifier "foo", writing the function as "(function foo()…ect." renders it as function-expression.
 
Function expression = the identifier foo is not bound in the enclosing global scope, but instead bound only inside its own function.
 
In other words, (function foo(){ .. }) as an expression means the identifier foo is found only in the scope where the .. indicates, not in the outer scope. Hiding the name foo inside itself means it does not pollute the enclosing scope unnecessarily.
 
Anonymous vs. Named
 
setTimeout( function(){
        console.log("I waited 1 second!");
}, 1000 );
 
From <https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch3.md> 
 
function expression as a callback parameter.
 
function expressions can be anonymous, but function declarations cannot omit the name.
 
Drawback of anonymous functions:
1) hard to debug, difficult to trace
2) difficult to self-reference for recursion
3) anonymous functions omit a name that is often helpful in providing readable/understandable code
 
Inline function expressions - addresses all the drawbacks to anonymous functions.
 
setTimeout( function timeoutHandler(){ // <-- Look, I have a name!
        console.log( "I waited 1 second!" );
}, 1000 );

Invoking Function Expressions Immediately
 
IIFE - Immediately Invoked Function Expression.
 
wrapping the function with ( ) pair and then executing it by adding the () on the ended.
(function foo(){ .. })()
 
var a = 2;
(function IIFE(){
var a = 3;
        console.log( a ); // 3
})();
console.log( a ); // 2
 
From <https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch3.md> 
 
IIFEs can be passed argument(s):
 
var a = 2;
(function IIFE( global ){
var a = 3;
        console.log( a ); // 3
        console.log( global.a ); // 2
})( window );
console.log( a ); // 
 
From <https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch3.md> 
 
window = object in the global
 
UMD (Universal Module Definition)
 
var a = 2;
(function IIFE( def ){
        def( window );
})(function def( global ){
var a = 3;
        console.log( a ); // 3
        console.log( global.a ); // 2
});
 
From <https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch3.md> 
 
The def function expression is defined in the second-half of the snippet, and then passed as a parameter (also called def) to the IIFE function defined in the first half of the snippet. Finally, the parameter def (the function) is invoked, passing window in as the global parameter.

Blocks As Scopes
 
Functions are the most common unit of scope.
 
Block-scoping = declaring variables as close as possible, as local as possible, to where they will be used.
 
var foo = true;
if (foo) {
        var bar = foo * 2;
        bar = something( bar );
        console.log( bar );
}
 
From <https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch3.md> 
 
bar is still belongs to the enclosing scope.
 
try/catch can create block scope.
 
let - keyword attaches the variable declaration to the scope of whatever block { . . } it's contained in. let implicitly hijacks any block's scope for its variable declaration.
 
var foo = true;
if (foo) {
        let bar = foo * 2;
        bar = something( bar );
        console.log( bar );
}
console.log( bar ); // ReferenceError
 
From <https://github.com/Egkrateia/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch3.md> 
 
Best practice to use explicit block-scoping style to make the block scope obvious.
 
declarations with let will not hoist to the entire scope of the block they appear in.
 
{
   console.log( bar ); // ReferenceError!
   let bar = 2;
}
 
From <https://github.com/Egkrateia/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch3.md> 
 
let loops
 
binds the variable declaration to the for loop, but also re-binds it for each iteration of the loop. This will become important with closure = garbage collection/resource management.
 
const creates block-scoped variables, but whose values are fixed. Attempt on changing their values will result in a reference error.
 
Review (TL;DR)
Functions are the most common unit of scope in JavaScript. Variables and functions that are declared inside another function are essentially "hidden" from any of the enclosing "scopes", which is an intentional design principle of good software.
But functions are by no means the only unit of scope. Block-scope refers to the idea that variables and functions can belong to an arbitrary block (generally, any { .. } pair) of code, rather than only to the enclosing function.
Starting with ES3, the try/catch structure has block-scope in the catch clause.
In ES6, the let keyword (a cousin to the var keyword) is introduced to allow declarations of variables in any arbitrary block of code. if (..) { let a = 2; } will declare a variable a that essentially hijacks the scope of the if's { .. } block and attaches itself there.
Though some seem to believe so, block scope should not be taken as an outright replacement of var function scope. Both functionalities co-exist, and developers can and should use both function-scope and block-scope techniques where respectively appropriate to produce better, more readable/maintainable code.
