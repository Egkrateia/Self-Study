Top();

Code runs top to down. Top(); runs first, definition or code inside Top(){} runs, then Middle();, followed by Bottom(); "PORTALING"

        
let keeps the variables scope to the {} - won't affect the scope of variables above it.

var keeps the variable's scope to the ENTIRE function, no matter how far nested it is.
